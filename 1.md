### **Vulnerability Observation**  
It was observed that the application provides a print feature for various functionalities, allowing users to download data in PDF format. However, the PDF files are accessible directly via their URLs without requiring authentication. This exposes potentially sensitive data to unauthorized users.

---

### **Proof of Concept (POC) Steps**  
1. Access the print feature for a specific functionality in the application.  
2. Use the print option to download the functionality's data as a PDF file.  
3. Extract the direct URL for the PDF file from the network traffic (e.g., using a browser's developer tools or a proxy tool like Burp Suite).  
4. Open the extracted URL in an incognito browser or a session without logging into the application.  
5. Confirm that the PDF file can be downloaded without authentication, demonstrating the lack of access controls.

### **Impact**  
This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the PDF files, violating data protection policies and exposing the application to data breaches.

### **Recommendation**  
Implement proper authentication and authorization checks to ensure that PDF files can only be accessed by authenticated users with the appropriate permissions.
