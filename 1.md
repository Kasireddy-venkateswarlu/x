Hereâ€™s a refined version of the **vulnerability observation** and **POC steps**:

---

### **Vulnerability Observation**  
It was observed that the application contains an admin login page (`login.jsp`) that transmits sensitive user credentials (username and password) using the HTTP `GET` method. This practice poses a security risk as the credentials are exposed in the browser history, proxy logs, and server logs, making them susceptible to unauthorized access.

### **Proof of Concept (POC) Steps**  
1. Navigate to the login page of the application: `login.jsp`.  
2. Attempt to log in with a sample username and password. Observe that the credentials are sent using the `GET` method instead of the more secure `POST` method.  
3. Verify that the credentials are visible in:  
   - The browser's URL bar (after form submission).  
   - Browser history.  
   - Proxy tools like Burp Suite or any HTTP traffic analyzer.  
   - Application server logs.

This vulnerability may allow attackers with access to logs or the user's device to retrieve sensitive information, violating secure data handling practices.
