### Vulnerability: **Improper Exposure of Demo Site Functionality**

---

#### **Description:**  
The application provides a publicly accessible demo site to showcase its features and functionalities. However, the demo site exposes overly structured and detailed functionality, mirroring the core application's features. This could allow attackers to gain insights into the application’s design, workflow, and implementation details. These insights might be exploited to conduct further attacks on the live application.

---

#### **Observation:**  
The demo site is accessible without proper restrictions or alternative controls.  
- It provides comprehensive application features identical to the production environment.  
- It does not implement separate credentials or restricted functionality for demonstration purposes.  
- Attackers can analyze the exposed demo site to identify potential vulnerabilities or design flaws.  

---

#### **Impact:**  
1. **Reconnaissance Opportunities:**  
   Attackers can use the demo site to understand application logic, identify sensitive functionalities, and plan more sophisticated attacks against the live environment.  

2. **Data Exposure:**  
   If the demo site shares code, configurations, or endpoints with the live system, any vulnerability discovered here could directly impact the production environment.  

3. **Brand Reputation Risk:**  
   A compromised demo site may lead to reduced trust in the application’s overall security posture.  

---

#### **Remediation:**  
1. **Implement Alternative Demo Site:**  
   - Create a standalone demo environment that mimics limited application features without exposing the complete functionality.  
   - Ensure this environment is isolated from the production infrastructure to prevent spillover risks.  

2. **Use Separate Credentials and Permissions:**  
   - Implement dedicated demo credentials with limited permissions to restrict access to sensitive operations.  
   - Prevent demo accounts from interacting with production data or endpoints.  

3. **Restrict Demo Features:**  
   - Showcase only essential, non-sensitive application functionalities on the demo site.  
   - Disable or limit sensitive operations, such as administrative tasks or data modifications.  

4. **Monitor Demo Site Activity:**  
   - Set up logging and monitoring for demo site activities to detect misuse or suspicious behavior.  

5. **Educate Users:**  
   - Clearly label the demo site as a non-production environment and communicate its purpose to users.
