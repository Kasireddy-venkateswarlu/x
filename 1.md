### Vulnerability Observation:
The application generates the same `X-user-Token` (used for authentication) for a user each time they log in. This token remains static and predictable. As a result, an attacker can launch a brute force attack to guess or compromise the `X-user-Token`, potentially impersonating the user and gaining unauthorized access.

### Impact:
If the `X-user-Token` is compromised, an attacker can:
1. **Impersonate the user**: Access sensitive information and perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.
2. **Compromise account security**: Exploit user accounts, leading to data breaches and loss of user trust.
3. **Escalate attacks**: Use the compromised account to pivot to other areas of the application or escalate privileges.

This significantly weakens the overall security of the application and puts user data and operations at risk.

### Remediation:
1. **Generate unique tokens per session**: Ensure that the `X-user-Token` is newly generated and unique every time a user logs in. Use secure random token generation techniques.
2. **Implement strong randomness**: Tokens should be long and generated using cryptographically secure methods (e.g., 256-bit random values).
3. **Set token expiration**: Ensure that tokens have a limited lifespan and require re-authentication after expiration.
4. **Rate limiting**: Apply rate-limiting mechanisms to prevent brute force attempts.
5. **Monitor token usage**: Log and monitor token usage patterns to detect and block abnormal activities, such as token reuse or suspicious access attempts.
6. **Secure token transmission**: Always transmit tokens over secure channels (e.g., HTTPS) to prevent interception.

By implementing these measures, the application can ensure robust session management and prevent unauthorized access through token brute-forcing.
