### Vulnerability PoC Steps:  

1. **Access the Delete User Feature**:  
   Log in to the application and navigate to the "Delete User" feature within the app.  

2. **Capture the Request**:  
   Click on the "Delete User" button, then capture the HTTP request using a tool like Burp Suite or browser developer tools to obtain the URL for the delete action.  

3. **Identify User Session**:  
   Confirm that the other user’s entry is available in the session or login. This could be an attacker-controlled user or the victim's session.  

4. **Craft Malicious Link**:  
   The attacker then crafts a URL with the delete request (captured earlier) that will trigger the deletion action. The crafted URL is designed to delete the user's account or perform an unwanted action on the victim's session.  

5. **Send the Malicious Link**:  
   The attacker sends the crafted link to the victim, often disguised as a legitimate link or in a phishing message.  

6. **Victim Clicks the Link**:  
   Once the victim clicks on the crafted link, the request is sent to the server, and the action is executed without the victim’s consent. The user’s account or session data is deleted.
