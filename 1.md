### Vulnerability Observation and Proof of Concept (PoC) Steps

#### Vulnerability Observation  
It was observed that the application is vulnerable to **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** via the `x` and `y` parameters. Two scenarios were tested to demonstrate the exploitation of this vulnerability:

**Scenario 1:**  
- A malicious URL was crafted by injecting a JavaScript payload designed to redirect users to a phishing page.  
- When a victim clicks the link, they are redirected to the phishing page, where any credentials entered are sent to an attacker-controlled server.

**Scenario 2:**  
- A malicious URL was crafted by injecting a JavaScript payload to read the content of the currently open page (after the victim clicks the link).  
- The payload sends the captured content to an attacker-controlled server for further exploitation.

#### Proof of Concept (PoC) Steps  

1. **Payload Injection:**  
   - A JavaScript payload was crafted to retrieve the content of the currently open page.  
   - The payload sends the extracted content to a Python-based attacker-controlled server in Base64 format.  

2. **Malicious URL Creation:**  
   - A URL containing the injected JavaScript payload was created and shared with the target user.  

3. **Execution:**  
   - The victim accessed the malicious URL.  
   - The injected JavaScript executed in the victim's browser, retrieving the content of the currently opened page.  
   - The retrieved content was sent to the attacker's server in Base64-encoded format.  

4. **Data Decoding:**  
   - On the attacker's side, the Base64-encoded content was decoded to obtain the HTML of the victim's page.

5. **Exploitation:**  
   - The attacker successfully viewed the content of the victim's currently open page, potentially extracting sensitive information.

This demonstration highlights the potential risks posed by the Reflected XSS vulnerability, including unauthorized data access and phishing attacks.
